This service included a National Ambulance Service (NAS), advanced paramedic (AP), an emergency medicine (EM) registrar and a senior occupational therapist (OT), in conjunction with local consultants in geriatric and EM. The remit was to attend emergency (999/112) calls to the NAS involving older adults for whom hospital admission might be avoided by providing comprehensive assessment in their own homes. Patients were not able to selfrefer; the ambulance service triaged calls. All three team members travelled and attended calls together. The AP provided initial assessment, scene management and worked with the doctor to complete clinical assessment and targeted investigations. The doctor had responsibility for arranging alternative care pathways if necessary. The OT provided assessment of cognition and function within the home environment, provided education to both patients and carers, organised equipment and linked with community services. All team members had to be in agreement if a patient was not to be conveyed to the ED. The service ran successfully for seven weekends.",

We were unable to secure extension of AP cover to 7 days due to competing demands during the pandemic, but weekend provision was successfully maintained. We made our service more accessible by introducing new referral pathways from the three hospitals in our community area, local paramedics (including patients that declined transfer to the ED) and our nursing home liaison service. General practitioners are able to access the service via a new 'geriatrician of the day' telephone system, which triages calls to the appropriate care service.",

Examples included assessment of acute delirium, dehydration, infection and advice on oxygen administration for patients with COVID-19 (see box 1 for example case). There were many questions about managing reactive behaviours in people with dementia in both private homes and in care homes, sometimes related to COVID-19 infection but in other cases due to restrictions imposed by the lockdown. In partnership with our geriatricians and infectious disease consultants, the hospital also offered additional outreach visits to care facilities to provide expertise on site.",

We undertook 21 additional visits to care homes to offer general clinical advice and infection control support. Twenty-two per cent (118) calls related to patients in care homes. The team averaged 130 km of travel per day and saw on average 5.6 patients per 10 hours shift. Some doctors on the team reported appreciating having the OT available to help with cognitive assessments, especially where mental capacity was a concern and treatment was being declined. Eighty-two patients received repeat visits after variable intervals depending on their clinical needs, for reassessment. This allowed a higher threshold for conveyance of patients whose risk assessment was considered to be borderline, with a shared decision-making framework used. We were also able to bridge gaps where other services were not immediately available, for example, setting up a syringe driver for urgent symptom control. Three patients died in their own homes, with the team providing palliative care support. While the service was not formally evaluated, no complaints or concerns were received.",

Strategies to provide alternatives to acute hospital admission may become even more important during this phase. Funding will be sought locally to maintain our care model of holistic comprehensive assessment brought to the patient.

The two types of order vary with temperature and peptide concentration in complex ways which depend on the membrane composition, highlighting the subtlety of the interaction between inclusions and the host bilayer. The amplitude of the variation is relatively low, indicating that the macroscopic constants used to describe the elasticity of the bilayer are unlikely to change with the addition of peptide.",

We combine two complementary techniques: wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) gives access Supplementary material in the form of a .pdf file available from the Journal web page at https://doi.org/10.1140/epje/i2018-11644-5 a e-mail: doru.constantin@u-psud.fr to the positional order between neighboring chains, while nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is sensitive to the orientational order of chain segments, thus yielding a comprehensive picture of the state of the membrane as a function of the concentration of inclusions. We study GramA inserted within bilayers composed of lipids with phosphocholine heads and saturated lipid chains: 1,2-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DLPC) and 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) or of single-chain surfactants with zwitterionic or nonionic head groups: dodecyl dimethyl amine oxide (DDAO) and tetraethyleneglycol monododecyl ether (C 12 EO 4 ), respectively, the hydrophobic length of DLPC (20.8\u00c5) [5] DDAO (18.4\u00c5) [6] and C 12 EO 4 (18.8\u00c5) [7] is shorter than that of GramA (22\u00c5) [9] , while DMPC (25.3\u00c5) [5] is longer. Since all these molecules form bilayers, and their hydrophobic length is close to that of GramA, the latter is expected to adopt the native helical dimer configuration described by Ketchem et al. [10] , and not the intertwined double helices observed in methanol [11] or in SDS micelles [12] .",

The (absolute value of the) 13 C-1 H orientation order parameter S CH = 3 cos 2 \u03b8 \u2212 1 /2, with \u03b8 the angle between the internuclear vector and the motional axis, is extracted from those dipolar couplings, and the variation of order profiles with temperature or cholesterol content has already been probed, with lipids that were difficult to deuterate [28, 29] . Using the same approach, we monitor the lipid or surfactant order profile when membranes are doped with different concentrations of gramicidin.",

The data treatment is simple for nonspecialists and the sample preparation is very easy since there is no need for isotopic enrichment.

In C 12 EO 4 membranes, the peak position q 0 decreases very slightly with temperature ( fig. 6 ), while the peak width is almost unchanged by temperature or gramicidin content ( fig. 7 (right) ). As an example, we observe a small decrease of q 0 with the temperature at P/L = 0.073 ( fig. 6 (left) ), as well as a very slight increase with P/L at 20 \u2022 C, as seen in fig. 6 (right) . If we take the overall WAXS peak position shift as a function of temperature and for all inclusions concentration (data not shown) we have a small temperature dependence for each P/L. Comparing the value in absence of inclusion, the peak position slightly shifts after adding gramicidin at a P/L = 0.015 but remains almost the same for the different gramicidin content, showing no significant influence of the inclusions on the C 12 EO 4 membranes. This conclusion is confirmed by the very modest change in the HWHM values presented in fig. 7 (right). At P/L = 0, the HWHM is very close to 2.6 nm \u22121 for all temperatures. As the gramicidin content increases, we observe a small gap between the different temperatures: the width stays constant or increases for the lower temperatures (up to about 40 \u2022 C) and decreases for the higher ones. This gap widens at high gramicidin content (P/L > 0.07).",

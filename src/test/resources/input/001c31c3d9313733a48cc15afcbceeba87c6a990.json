Among many prognostic parameters, three hemodynamic indices: right atrial pressure, cardiac index, and mixed venous saturation are considered critically important for correct risk classification. All of them are measured invasively and require right heart catheterization (RHC). The study was aimed to verify assumption that a model based on non-invasive parameters is able to predict hemodynamic profile described by the mentioned invasive indices. A group of 330 patients with pulmonary hypertension was used for the selection of the best predictors from the set of 17 functional, biochemical, and echocardiographic parameters. Multivariable logistic regression models for the prediction of low-risk and high-risk profiles were created. The cut-off points were determined and subsequent validation of the models was conducted prospectively on another group of 136 patients. The ROC curve analysis showed the very good discrimination power of the models (AUC 0.80-0.99) in the prediction of the hemodynamic profile in the total validation group and subgroups: PAH and CTEPH. The models indicated the risk profiles with moderate sensitivity (57-60%) and high specificity (87-93%). The method enables estimation of the hemodynamic indices when RHC cannot be performed.",

            "text": "Targeted therapy of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) requires regular assessment of its efficacy and individual risk stratification [1] . Besides medical history and physical examination, the routine follow-up of PAH patient includes TTE, 6-minute walk test (6MWT), and laboratory tests, especially measurement of NT-terminated brain natriuretic pro-B-type peptide plasma concentration (NTproBNP). Right heart catheterization is considered an important if not indispensable element of long-term monitoring. Hemodynamic profiles critical for correct prognostic classification are defined by three universally acknowledged prognostic indices measured during right heart catheterization (RHC): mean right atrial pressure (mRAP), cardiac index (CI) and mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO 2 ). Recent attempt to limit PAH follow-up to non-invasive assessment was based on functional class, 6MWT and NTproBNP but disregarded TTE [2] . We are aware that, while specific TTE parameters provide a potential opportunity to estimate two of the mentioned indices, namely mRAP and CI, the accuracy of these estimates was contested [1, [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Also, to the best of our knowledge, no single non-invasive methods was shown useful to predict SvO 2 . However, we wanted to explore if, combining information from TTE with other non-invasive variables into a multivariate model, we would be able to predict prognostic results of RHC without actually performing it. It should be emphasized that many of non-invasive parameters have proven prognostic value both in PAH and CTEPH [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] .",

As mentioned above, 13 echocardiographic parameters available in most cases of training group were collected into the research database. Inferior vena cava expiratory (IVCex) and inspiratory diameter (IVCin) were measured from substernal view. The patients were asked to perform a sniff during IVCin measurement. Collapsibility index of inferior vena cava (IVCcoll) was calculated according to the following equation: IVCcoll = (IVCex-IVCin)/IVCex. Right atrial area (RAA) was defined as the largest cross section area of right atrium in apical view. Diameter of the right ventricle outflow tract (RVOT) was measured in a left parasternal view, while the right ventricle inflow tract was measured in an apical 4-chamber view. Right to left ventricle ratio (RV/LV) was based on measurements received in an apical 4-chamber view and was defined as the right ventricle inflow diameter divided by left ventricle inflow diameter. The right ventricle wall thickness (RV wall) was measured in subcostal or parasternal view in basal segment. The main pulmonary artery diameter (MPA) was measured during diastole in parasternal view, subcostal or modified view. Hereby, the largest value was taken into account and the thickness of the artery wall was not included in measurement. Left atrial anterior-posterior diameter (LA) was measured in long axis parasternal view. Tricuspid annulus plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) was measured in an apical 4-chamber view. Acceleration time (AcT) was measured in the right ventricle out-flow tract in short-axis parasternal view using pulsed wave Doppler imaging. Peak gradient of tricuspid regurgitation (TRPG) was calculated according to a simplified Bernoulli equation using the highest value of the maximal velocity of tricuspid regurgitation jet measured in any of available views. Parameters expressing distance or area (IVCex, IVCin, RAA, LA, MPA, RVwall, RVOT, RVIT, TAPSE) were used in further calculations in two ways: as direct values and values indexed to the patient's height and BSA.",

            "text": "Since 1981, when Mintz et al. published their research on the correlation between diameter of inferior vena cava measured by ultrasonography and right heart catheterization findings, many investigators have searched mathematical relationship between each of two hemodynamic indices, namely mRAP and CI, with various non-invasive parameters [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . Most of the studies were focused on the prediction of elevated mRAP, which is an important marker of unfavorable prognosis in PAH and other life-threatening cardiovascular conditions [29, 30] . Although knowledge of normal mRAP is useful in the management of PH patients, one should remember that it can coexist with abnormal values of CI or SvO 2 , so normal mRAP does not exclude necessity of treatment intensification. In our analysis we found only weak to moderate correlations between mRAP, CI and SvO 2 (Supplementary Table S2 ). It is important for practical purposes to know values of all three indices. The presented analysis indicated that several non-invasive parameters correlate with each of the mentioned indices. Moreover, we found that some of parameters were able to identify patient with normal values of all three indices (the low-risk hemodynamic profile) as well as those who have at least one critically incorrect indicator (the high-risk hemodynamic profile). The univariable analysis showed that commonly used markers of the right ventricle failure such as RAA or NTproBNP allow to distinguish low, intermediate, and high risk hemodynamic profiles with reasonable accuracy. Our analysis confirmed the usefulness of cut of points of low-risk and high-risk values of RAA or NTproBNP recommended by current guidelines [1] . Looking for a more accurate method of identification low-risk and high-risk category we found advantage of the multivariate logistic regression models based on three echocardiographic parameters (IVCin, RAA, TAPSE) and a biochemical marker (NTproBNP) over any of tested univariate tests (Figure 3 ). This superiority turned out below statistical significance in the subgroups of PAH and CTEPH patients and this issue should be checked on a larger group of group 1 and group 4 PH patients. Estimation using IRTB models was associated with 2-3 times fewer errors defined as critical misclassification.",

This approach is based on low morbidity and mortality rates of RHC reported by the expert centers. However, in some circumstances purely non-invasive prognostic assessment would be welcomed in patients with confirmed diagnosis of PAH or CTEPH. The present COVID-19 pandemic, e.g., may limit access for PH patients to sites with adequate experience in performing RHC. Suspending public interurban passenger transport due to epidemic reasons constitutes a serious obstacle to regular patients visit in PH centers. The proposed models of the hemodynamic profile estimations allow to predict hemodynamic profile on the basis of conventional echocardiographic examination and NTproBNP serum level measurement performed in the place of patient's residence. The value of the IRTB models can help a PH expert to suggest optimized solutions based on objectively assessed data obtained during teleconsultation.",

Most of the previous studies analyzed individual PH groups separately and this approach makes interpretation of results easier. However, the etiology of PH is often unknown at a stage of initial diagnostic, which contains both echocardiographic examination and biochemical biomarkers assessment. Moreover, there can be doubt about the etiology of PH despite extensive invasive and non-invasive differential diagnoses in some cases. Our test may provide alarming or reassuring prognostic message related to hemodynamic status but derived from four noninvasive parameters still before establishing final diagnosis. This information can be compared with similar assessment performed after treatment initiation. Independently of PH etiology, the result of the IRTB test indicating the high-risk category should encourage to accelerate further diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. We expect that the test could be useful during PAH and CTEPH patient monitoring, but further studies are necessary to confirm this assumption.",

The IRTB models integrate prognostic information resulting from TTE and NTproBNP assessment in a quantitative form, as a numerical value of probability of high-risk or low-risk category. We also proposed a cut-off points of mentioned probability to simplify distinguishing between low-risk, intermediate and high-risk patient.

We did not include parameters derived from so-called new echocardiographic technics (tissue Doppler, strain, 3D). The study did not analyze if the IRTB models were able to predict hemodynamic improvement or deterioration during a patient's follow-up. Finally, our study provides only indirect validation of prognostic value of IRTB models, based on noninvasive assignment to prognostic strata according to RHC. It would be of key importance to compare it with prognostic value of RHC. It cannot be excluded that the IRTB test may actually perform similarly or even better to RHC in predicting mortality. Since the majority of patients from the validation subgroups remain under our care, we hope to provide this data in the future. The planned study should also take into account the different prognostic significance of non-invasive parameters in PAH patients with and without comorbidities. The necessity to use different prognostic parameters in patients with PAH and cardio-pulmonary comorbidities was demonstrated for the first time by Xanthouli et al. in a recently published paper [38] , and this issue was not known at the time of designing our study.",

Four of them (IVCin, RAA, TAPSE, and NTproBNP) demonstrated the highest prediction value and was used in multivariate logistic regression models. The models were shown to be more accurate in hemodynamic profile prediction than univariate tests in general PH population and had high ability to identify low-risk and high-risk categories in PAH patients (AUC 0.90-0.94) as well as CTEPH patients (AUC 0.80-0.99). It can be presumed that risk assessment based on a multivariable model will bring measurable clinical benefits over assessment based on a single non-invasive predictor. The IRTB models identified both normal and unfavorable hemodynamic profiles with moderate sensitivity (57-60%), good PPV (74-75%), high specificity (87-93%), and a low number of critical misclassification errors (1.5%). The use of the models should be considered when RHC performing is not possible. ",

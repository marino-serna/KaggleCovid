Disaster triggering events obviously differ, but analogous approaches to development, privileging economic growth over social and environmental values and priorities are key factors in their occurrence. As in all disasters, the pandemic represents the materialization of underlying risk conditions. In that context, disasters in general now constitute a pandemic J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f because a global population is facing a set of similar social and economic processes that coupled with systemic environmental hazards, generate disasters.",

By virtue of their strategic importance, greater connectivity was stimulated by the development of global markets. However, that connectivity is also characterized by social inequalities that skew development towards some and away from J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f others. In addition, international travel, voluntary and involuntary human displacements, including those of refugees, migration patterns and population hubs effectively involve a notion of places as coupled, in which those social interactions construct greater exposure (Newland, 2020) .",

Thus far there have been two main types of risk management J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f policies. Policies have been implemented, with varying degrees of success or failure, primarily to address the risks of morbidity and mortality through forms of epidemiological control, policies of confinement, social distancing, mask wearing and through strengthening public health services to avoid system collapse. A second type of risk management policies, launched by many governments and regional and multilateral organizations, basically aims at ameliorating the economic impacts of the first set of strategies and include fiscal and monetary measures to mitigate the impact of health risk management actions. Deferral of tax payments, partial payment of salaries, and injection of liquidity into financial systems have also been used to diminish the impact of lost revenues on both the population and the economic system. While unquestionably effective in staving off the most acute economic impacts for impacted populations, the political viability of such options has placed the necessary continuation of many of these strategies in doubt as the pandemic progresses into subsequent phases.",

The pandemic has revealed that what was \"normal\" is the source of vulnerability and exposure, thus requiring policies to enact the necessary transformational responses to health, climate, and other disaster risks now. The early stages of the pandemic also showed that financial resources can be made available at a level thought impossible as little as six months ago. It has also revealed that a significant political will, normally conspicuously absent in dealing with other global issues can be mobilized to address a global crisis. And it has shown that strong and effective measures to reduce contagion risk can be made where social institutions and political structures are competent, well organized and supported. The longer term durability of such measures, however, is absolutely essential for success in combatting the virus. While the epidemiological perspective is obviously essential, framing the pandemic as a disaster alerts us to the significance of the causal chain of root causes and risk drivers and their interactions with existing or novel hazards, both across and within territorial and governance scales.",

Unquestionably, the pandemic will change the world: perhaps for the better, if it leads to policies that address the underlying risk drivers, or for worse if it furthers greater authoritarianism, suppression of individual guarantees and rights, exacerbation of inequality and protection of entrenched economic and financial interests over and above human security. In effect, the pandemic has both demonstrated a dire need and opened a window of opportunity to move both national and global systems toward more just and equitable conditions.",
